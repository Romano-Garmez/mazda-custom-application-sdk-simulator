# Simulator for Custom Applications SDK 

Updated by [Roman Garms](https://github.com/Romano-Garmez) to be buildable in 2024. 

Fixes include:
- Reload applications option now works
- Reload runtime option now works
- Can disable keyboard shortcuts for the multicommander (prevent pressing arrow keys in number fields from affecting your CASDK app)
- Can open CASDK app in external browser (useful for testing your CASDK app CSS in Opera 12, though logic is still handled in the electron app)
